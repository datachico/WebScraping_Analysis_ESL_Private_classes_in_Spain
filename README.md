Understand the competitive landscape of any industry by analyzing publically available data. 
The following is a case study that examines the Spanish ESL market using the most popular private teacher website.

# Introduction

As a new English teacher, I'm curious about the overall ESL market in Spain. Specifically:

Offered price. Which regions have the highest and lowest price offerings? Do ratings matter? How does teacher price compare to cost of living?
Teacher demand. Are there certain areas where teachers are under or over-represented based on population and does this affect the offered price?
Native vs. non-native instructors. What is the breakdown between native and non-native English speakers and is there a difference in asking price?
Reviews. Do reviews affect the price and what percentage of teachers have reviews?
Paid advertising. What percentage of teachers pay for advertising on the site and does it give a discernable advantage?
Search results. Who is at the top? Does the algorithm favor teachers with reviews, paying customers, new teachers, teachers with a photoâ€¦.?
